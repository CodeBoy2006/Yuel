## [2026-06-27 20:39] Yuel MV3 Scaffold
- **Changes:** Initialized a WXT/React MV3 extension with Tailwind, Dexie storage schema, content-script reading event collection, background message routing, Pack validation, UI shells, tests, and documentation.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Next Steps:** Build the runtime whitelist flow and replace starter-site static matching with user-controlled optional host permission registration.
- **Context:** Use `CI=true` with pnpm commands in this environment. The generated manifest keeps broad hosts in `optional_host_permissions`; current static content-script matches cover only starter reading sites.

## [2026-06-27 21:16] Reading Exposure Aggregates
- **Changes:** Added `TextBlockExposureTick` events, periodic content-script exposure ticks, pure reading batch aggregation tests, and repository updates that accumulate chunk/page/daily reading stats from measured exposure.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Next Steps:** Connect popup, side panel, or dashboard UI to IndexedDB so users can see today’s real reading totals.
- **Context:** Effective words are capped per text chunk during storage updates; vocabulary exposure updates now only run for chunks that had measurable exposure in the batch.

## [2026-06-27 21:20] Popup Reading Stats
- **Changes:** Added a tested `readingStats` query layer for today’s local reading summary and wired popup metrics to real IndexedDB-backed values instead of static placeholders.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Next Steps:** Add a dashboard or side panel detail view for recent pages, top domains, and vocabulary exposure so the local data pipeline has a richer user-facing surface.
- **Context:** Popup now reports loading, empty, and unavailable states while keeping the query logic isolated in `src/storage/readingStats.ts`.
